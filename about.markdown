Unmapped Worlds is a blog about video games.

I love exploring video game worlds and I writing about my experience. I hope to focus on indie titles, although I'll likely venture into AAA territory as well.

I have a particular approach to enjoying games, and I hope like-minded souls will enjoy reading what I write.
