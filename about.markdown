Unmapped Worlds is a blog about video games.

I've always hated magical maps with built-in GPS in games. They often take away the thrill of exploration, and the ability of the protaginst to instantly know where they are rarely makes sense in-universe. For me, becoming familiar with the landscapes and learning to navigate digital worlds is an engaging part of gameplay, and I appreciate when games challenge you to truly engage with their environments.

I love how cosmic dread makes you feel insignificant and how science fantasy makes you feel ignorant. I deeply enjoy and chase the feeling of getting to cozy cabins in harsh survival games (and hoarding provisions within them). I like when games don't hold you by the hand and treat you like an adult. I enjoy optimization problems.

This blog started as an experiment to get over my writer's block and publish something about video games every Monday - and I've been having a great time so far. I'm still looking for my voice, but I aim to focus on indie titles, although I'll likely venture into AAA territory as well. I've been mulling over some takes on game development and takes on the genres, which I'm starting to include. Hopefully like-minded souls will enjoy reading what I write.
