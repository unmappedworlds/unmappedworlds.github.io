Unmapped Worlds is a blog about video games.

I've always hated magical maps with built-in GPS in games. They often take away the thrill of exploration, and the ability of the protaginst to instantly know where they are rarely makes sense in-universe. For me, becoming familiar with the landscapes and learning to navigate digital worlds is an engaging part of gameplay, and I appreciate when games challenge you to trule engage with their environments.

I love how cosmic dread makes you feel insignificant and how science fantasy makes you feel ignorant. I deeply enjoy and chase the feeling of getting to cozy cabins in harsh survival games (and hoarding provisions within them). I like when games don't hold you be the hand and treat you like an adult. I enjoy optimization problems.

I'm yet to find my voice, but I aim to focus on indie titles, although I'll likely venture into AAA territory as well. Hopefully like-minded souls will enjoy reading what I write.
