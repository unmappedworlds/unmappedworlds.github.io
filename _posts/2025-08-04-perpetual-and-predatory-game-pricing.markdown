I've spent a lot of time thinking about predatory pricing in games, and I've realized my feelings on the matter are a mess of contradictions and personal biases. My initial revulsion was largely directed at games like The Sims 4. The idea of a game where the full experience costs over $1,000 feels like a scam, a transparent and cynical attempt to nickel-and-dime players to death. Electronic Arts being the publisher doesn't really help add the credibility to the business model.

But here's the thing - I'm starting to see that this view is uncharitable, and maybe even a bit naive. The truth is, that price tag represents over a decade of content. For a discerning fan who loves the minutiae of building a digital life, those many expansion packs, game packs, and kits might not be an obscene cost, but a steady investment in a hobby. The price was spread out for the majority of consumers who bought the packs over time, not all at once.

*The Sims 4: you're looking to pay well over a thousand dollars to unlock all the content.*

But there's another game that follows a slow, steady release of paid content for an evolving game, which I enthusiastically embrace.

I am, of course, talking about Total War: Warhammer. For the uninitiated, it's a brilliant, chaotic strategy game that drops you into the grim-dark fantasy universe of Warhammer. Think a more brutal, less moral Tolkien, with a better sense of humor. You've got larger-than-life characters and memorable (albeit somewhat generic) factions with fun twists: like the spiteful dwarfs, who once declared a war over mistakenly being shorted two coins. It's glorious, over-the-top fun.

The full trilogy, with all its DLC, costs a significant sum: I think you're looking at over $400 for the full experience. But, like The Sims, that cost has been spread out over nearly a decade of releases. The difference for me is in how that content feels. It's not just more stuff; it's a living world that's been constantly reworked and improved by a community and a passionate developer team.

Major patches haven't just added new units; they've completely overhauled entire factions, breathing new life into old campaigns. We've seen major reworks to the Beastmen and Greenskins, turning them from one-dimensional hordes into rich, engaging experiences. We've seen significant balance changes, new legendary lords, and quality-of-life improvements that make the game of today almost unrecognizable from its original release. And this isn't a one-way street, either. These improvements are often driven by an engaged community, with developers (sometimes) actively listening to player feedback and using it to refine and enrich the game world. It makes every purchase feel like a contribution to a shared, evolving project.

I've come to believe the real difference between these two pricing models for me isn't about the raw cost or the spread-out purchases. The difference is the feeling of what you're paying for.

When playing The Sims 4, my experience always felt like I was nudged to buy back a part of the game that had been purposefully stripped away. The constant reminders of missing content felt less like an invitation to a larger world and more like a guilt trip.

*Total War: Warhammer III: I'll gladly keep on paying for awesome, meaningful content.*

With Total War: Warhammer, a purchase feels like a genuine expansion of an already great thing. It's an investment in a developer team that I see working to make the game better, richer, and more complex. It's a payment for more of the epic, world-shattering stories I love, not for something I feel I should have had from the start.

This brings me to the "in-between" games - live service shooters like Destiny. Here, the crux of my dislike is that the constant stream of new content packs and events can feel more like bloat than genuine additions. While I can appreciate a developer's need to keep things fresh, it often feels disconnected from the world itself. The DLCs for Warhammer and Stellaris, on the other hand, feel like coherent, lore-friendly additions. Even something like the Chaos Dwarfs DLC, which is extremely complex and clearly targeted at expert players, feels like it belongs in the world. It's a purposeful, integrated expansion of the story and the world, not just a new season pass or event to keep people busy.

In the end, I'm okay with paying a lot for my gaming experience, as long as it's for an experience I feel truly justifies its cost. The line between "predatory" and "perpetual" is a fine one, and it turns out that line is drawn not by a publisher's business model, but player's personal satisfaction.
