For the past 8 months, I've been sharing weekly essays about video games. I started this blog anonymously because I wanted to experiment with a different voice. Writing without my name attached meant less fear of failure, which gave me permission to try things - different styles, higher cadence, vulnerable topics, deeply uncomfortable honesty. It's how I ended up sharing things I never expected to put online, like [my grief journey after losing my son](/posts/death-stranding-and-the-exploration-of-grief/).

Over these months, I've realized how much I love this. Putting thoughts on paper. Hitting publish. Knowing that some folks actually read these words. And I've come to believe that who I am matters to the writing - authorial intent or not, these essays are a distillation of my experiences. I wanted you to know me. So I'm attaching my name to it.

*Hi, I'm Rooslawn - which is a phonetic spelling of my name. It's nice to meet you.*

I grew up in a post-Soviet state and moved to the United States when I was 18. I'm in my mid-30s now, living in sunny San Diego with a wife and daughter I love deeply (though you've probably gathered that from my constant complaining about having no time because of my infant). I adore video games. By day, I'm a software engineer - a career born from a lifelong obsession with computers. If that side of me interests you, I write about tech and career stuff on [my personal site](https://rosipov.com).

I've always hated magical maps with built-in GPS in games. They often take away the thrill of exploration, and the ability of the protaginst to instantly know where they are rarely makes sense in-universe. For me, becoming familiar with the landscapes and learning to navigate digital worlds is an engaging part of gameplay, and I appreciate when games challenge you to truly engage with their environments.

I love how cosmic dread makes you feel insignificant and how science fantasy makes you feel ignorant. I deeply enjoy and chase the feeling of getting to cozy cabins in harsh survival games (and hoarding provisions within them). I like when games don’t hold you by the hand and treat you like an adult. I enjoy optimization problems.

Moving forward, I'll keep writing weekly through the first year of this blog. After that, I'll reevaluate. Sustainability is an open question.

See you in the essays - I have a pretty exciting December lined up. If you've enjoyed my writing, I'd love to have you stick around. You can subscribe to my [newsletter](/newsletter/) or find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/unmappedworlds.bsky.social) as I'm trying to figure out social media.
